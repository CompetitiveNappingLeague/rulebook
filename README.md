# Competitive Napping
Competitive Napping is a "sport" that allows participants to compete against each other and see who is the "stronger napper".

## How do you play?
Napping is the core of the sport, and so it is worth defining. Within the context of the sport, it is a short, 20 minute sleep session where the napper attains the deepest sleep possible. This can be played either solo, ranked against other competitors, or head-to-head.

## Rules
* Competitions are divided into several heats
* A sleep heat consists of 20 minutes
* within a single heat, a contestent must attain the deepest sleep as quickly as possible
* The athletes are rated and refereed by someone with a medical background who is capable of rating sleep, or technological equivalents
* Deductions may be leveed upon cramps and frequent or intense (shock) body movement
* Athletes must sleep on similar resting objects (same couch/bed/pillow/etc.), but are allowed personal choice in pajamas
* personal pillows are always allowed regardless of venue
